          Painting

        <p>
          I painted a lot in middle school but fell out of the hobby in favor of other activities. Last year, I was put in an art class and it sparked my desire to paint once again.

          Crochet
        </h3>
        <p>
          I started crocheting at the end of July 2019. I had knitted before but not crocheted. What had inspired me to start crocheting was seeing someone crochet a temperature blanket. I didn't know what it was at the time, I just loved the colors. So I asked her how she chose the colors and she explained to me that it was a temperature blanket. A temperature blanket is a blanket that's colors are based upon the weather. The creator chooses a set amount of time to make the blanket. Her's was Jan-Dec of 2019. Mine is my senior year, Aug 2019-May 2020. Then they choose a color range based on the temperature of their area. I have 9 yarn, each representing a 5 degree increment. Lastly, they just crochet each row of the blacket based on the day's temperature and the corresponding color.
         </p>
           <p>
          Below is my color/temperature key and my blanket as of March 31st.

          Cooking
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cooking is a hobby that was sparked by qurantine. I had always enjoyed cooking bit felt like I never have enough knowledge or time. Quarantine provided me the time, so I hunted the knowledge. I have recently become vegetarian so most of my meals have centered around tofu, but not all of them.
